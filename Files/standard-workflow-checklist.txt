🚀 Pro Tips:

Copy this template for EVERY client - consistency is key
Track your time - Know your true hourly rate
Update the template based on lessons learned
Automate what you can - Email templates, deployment scripts
Block out phases on your calendar - don't interrupt workflow

📈 Using This to Scale:
Once you've done 3-5 clients:

You'll know exactly how long each phase takes
You can spot bottlenecks
You can delegate specific phases (e.g., design, testing)
You can create SOPs for each phase
You can hire help for routine tasks
