# Portfolio Deployment Guide
**How to Get Your Portfolio Live in 5 Minutes**

## Recommended: Netlify (Free Forever)

Netlify is the easiest way to deploy your portfolio. It's completely free, includes HTTPS, and is used by major companies.

### Step 1: Create a Netlify Account
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "Sign up" (use GitHub, email, or Google)
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Deploy Your Portfolio
1. Log into Netlify
2. Look for the **"Add new site"** button (usually center of dashboard)
3. Click **"Deploy manually"** (the drag & drop option)
4. Drag your entire portfolio folder into the upload area
5. Wait 30-60 seconds... Done! ✅

Your portfolio is now live at a URL like: `your-portfolio-abc123.netlify.app`

### Step 3: (Optional) Use Your Own Domain
1. In Netlify, click **"Domain settings"**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `marclarouche.com`)
4. Follow the instructions to update your domain's DNS settings
5. Netlify automatically adds HTTPS (usually takes 5-10 minutes)

## Alternative: Vercel (Also Free)

Vercel is equally good and works almost identically to Netlify.

### Quick Steps:

2. Sign up (free account)
3. Click **"Add New Project"**
4. Click **"Deploy"** without connecting to Git
5. Drag your portfolio folder
6. Click **"Deploy"**

Done! Your site is live.

## Alternative: GitHub Pages (For GitHub Users)

If you use GitHub, this is a great option.

### Quick Steps:
1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Upload your portfolio files to the repo
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
4. Select **"Deploy from a branch"** → `main` branch
5. Save

Your portfolio will be live at: `yourusername.github.io/repo-name`
